Subutai Agent is a daemon written in Golang whose main task is to receive commands from the Subutai Social management server and execute them on Resource Hosts.  
Behind such a seemingly simple task are complex procedures like bidirectional ssl communication, gpg message encryption, different health and security checks, etc.
